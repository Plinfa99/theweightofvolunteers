          What would happen if every volunteer worker in Germany would stop?<br><br>


This project makes something visible that is usually invisible: the quiet presence of people who give their time, not for money, but because they care. Volunteers aren’t just part of society — they are the soft net that catches us when things get heavy.

Without them, some of us would lose someone to talk to. Others would lose the safe space where their children can grow. Some might feel alone in hospitals, at school, or at the end of life.

In the end, this isn’t just about missing services.
It’s about missing kindness. Connection. Hope.<br><br>

Volunteering isn’t extra.
It’s the glue that quietly holds us together.<br>
